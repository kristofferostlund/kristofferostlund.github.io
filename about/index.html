In July, 2014, I founded a software consultancy firm called East Grove Software in which I develop websites and programs for other businesses. Later that year, in September, <del>I fled the country</del> I moved to London to experience something completely new. Additionally, I am also studying Information Technology at university, from which I have grown an interest of blogging.</p><p>As most people I have met in real life would agree with, I love coffee. Seriously, coffee is love, coffee is life. I believe my fascination with the brew started somewhere around 2012, which in 2013 grew even stronger as I for a year worked as a certified barista (yes, I have a diploma on it). Fast forward a few months and I just moved to London, where I to start off had to resort to drinking instant coffee (I get a weird feeling just writing this) due to lack of equipment. I decided to teach myself how to do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WgFkgaoYZM">cold brew coffee</a>, <a href=http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/07/how-to-make-better-french-press-coffee-tips-technique-grind-timing.html>French press coffee</a>, and a <a href=http://www.whittard.co.uk/tea/related/hall-of-fame/v60-pour-over-kit.htm>pour over kit</a>. So uhm yeah, I enjoy coffee.</p><hr><h1>I do <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/pub/kristoffer-%C3%B6stlund/8a/44/aa2>work stuff</a>.</h1><p>Fresh out of whatever the English translation of pre-university would be called, I started a one-man B2B software consultancy under the name East Grove Software. This has given me the opportunity to work closely together with clients to develop both in-house and commercial software solutions on their behalf. Before this, I worked as a certified barista for one of Sweden's leading coffee shop, serving an array of different coffee drinks to a very varied crowd of people.</p><p>The projects I have worked on are written using different frameworks, languages and platforms. For instance, one projected is written in C# and XAML using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa970268(v=vs.110).aspx">WPF</a> (using the .NET core, obviously), another one is written in HTML5, SASS and JavaScript, and a third project is written on the <a href="http://mean.io/">MEAN stack</a> but with <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> for the front-end and SASS for styling.</p><h1>I also do <a href=https://soundcloud.com/y67>music</a>.</h1><p>When I have the time, I will write here that I actually produce music as well. For now I will just <a href=https://soundcloud.com/y67>link to it</a>.</p><div class=images><a href=https://twitter.com/kris_ostlund><img src=/assets/images/twitter_dark.png alt=Twitter class=image></a> <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/pub/kristoffer-%C3%B6stlund/8a/44/aa2><img src=/assets/images/linkedin_dark.png alt=LinkedIn class=image></a> <a href=https://github.com/kristofferostlund><img src=/assets/images/github_dark.png alt=GitHub class=image></a></div></div></div></div></body></html>
