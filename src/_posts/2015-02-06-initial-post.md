*Hello World, right?* 

In fact, he did not know what was to come, but boy, would he be amazed.

Honestly, I have no idea about what I am doing right now, but I thought it would be a fun experiment to see what happens when I use different stuff.

For instance, I assume links are made [like so](http://ostlundk.wordpress.com).

Ooh, and I think lists can be made like this: 

* I hope
* Otherwise this will look stupid.

### I am hoping this is a title

So, with all things in mind, which is not very much as I am completely new to this type of blogging, i fell the need to try out even more things.

Hmm, I feel like trying some highlighting out...

{% highlight coffeescript %}

coffee = () ->
  return "Always."

{% endhighlight %}


Oooh, and supposedly you can highlight `some things` using the ` thingy.

Yes, I feel I definitely could see myself blogging with this.
