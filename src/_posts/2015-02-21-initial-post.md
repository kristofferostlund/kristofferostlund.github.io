Yet another post pretty much saying hi, again.

In the near future I will put up a post explaining how I built this page, as it seems to be the norm to do so. For me, though, it would mainly be for myself, as I added lots of things I have not been worked with before.

For instance, I have dabbled slightly with [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) to host comments. Also, this is technically my second project using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), but it was the first time for me setting everything up, which obviously means some minor issues and other fun stuff. Oh, and visits to StackOverflow.

The main reason I yet have not started writing is I just have not had the time to do so. Currently, I am working on two projects with clients in Sweden. One of which being [SmartTitler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lVMO1fK8ps) together with [WestreamU](http://westreamu.se/), and [Vilth](https://vilth.se/) together with a Swedish start-up with a very long name. Oh, and other than that I also study full time in University, so I have tried spending most of my free time actually seeing other humans!

This will be it for now, thank you for reading.
